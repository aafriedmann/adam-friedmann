# Hello!

My Name is **Adam Friedmann**.
This is an exercise I did to create a repo.

I will add more information as time goes on.

I am going to learn Markdown as well. I will learn it by:

* Practicing
* Trial and Error
* Copying samples and observing the output.

I will be using [this reference](htpps://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as a guide.

One day *soon* I will be a **Markdown master**.
